            <p class="Typo-body-regular">
              Piohní was founded upon a quest for tranquility amidst the chaos of everyday life. Like the Midas touch of health, Piohní offers a moment of tranquility amidst the chaos of modern life. Our foundation centers on simplicity, grounded in
              the belief that less is often more.<br />
              <br />At the core of Piohní's philosophy lies a commitment to excellence. We proudly curate only the most exceptional ceremonial-grade matcha, meticulously sourced directly from the esteemed "Champagne" region of Japan. Renowned for its
              pristine quality and unparalleled flavor profile, our matcha embodies a harmonious blend of creaminess and sweetness, without a trace of bitterness.

            <p class="Typo-body-regular">
              My journey into the world of matcha began with a personal quest for peace. Recognizing the profound calmness matcha brought to my life, I was driven by the belief that everyone deserves to experience such serenity daily, not just
              occasionally. However, I encountered a common issue: the matcha available often fell short, either lacking in quality or altogether absent from menus.<br /><br /> After two years of relentless exploration spanning the globe, I sifted through
              147 varieties of matcha in search of the perfect brew. My journey led me to the verdant tea gardens nestled in the southernmost reaches of Japan, where I discovered the ultimate matcha – a blend that transcended all others in taste and quality.<br
              /><br />
              Today, Piohní stands as a beacon of serenity, offering authentic Japanese matcha that warms the heart and soothes the soul. Join us in savoring the simple joys of life, one cup of matcha at a time.
